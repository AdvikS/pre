- Include winsorizing points for linear variables in pre objects

- when functions of input variables are used in defining the pre formula, an error results when
	using predict.pre()

- Implement parallel computing for cv.glmnet function. Example:
	require(doMC)
	registerDoMC(cores=4)
	x = matrix(rnorm(1e5 * 100), 1e5, 100)
	y = rnorm(1ee5)
	system.time(cv.glmnet(x,y))
	system.time(cv.glmnet(x,y,parallel=TRUE))

- Implement parallel computing for growing trees when learnrate == 0

- Plotting of interaction statistics should be separate from their calculation

- Plotting function for full ensemble as a simple tree forest

- Support for multivariate outcomes

- Support for multinomial, censored and poisson regression

- Support for multilevel data
