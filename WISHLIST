- Fix bug: pre() and bsnullinteract() may provide unreproducible results when 
    par.init = TRUE and parallel = TRUE, respectively. At least when package 
    doParallel is used. This should be fixable by using doRNG package and 
    running registerDoRNG(seed = .), but then objects in the environment seem 
    not to be passed to the workers, and an error results. This can be fixed by 
    passing objects from the environment to foreach(), but this may in turn 
    slow down computations.
