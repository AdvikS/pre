- Include winsorizing points for linear variables in pre objects (first step already taken: pre 
	objects now include winslim, an object with the winsorizing limits used)

- when functions of input variables are used in defining the pre formula, an error results when:
	* in using scale function when using pre()
	* in using predict.pre()
	* .....

- Implement parallel computing for cv.glmnet function. Example:
	require(doMC)
	registerDoMC(cores=4)
	x = matrix(rnorm(1e5 * 100), 1e5, 100)
	y = rnorm(1e5)
	system.time(cv.glmnet(x,y))
	system.time(cv.glmnet(x,y,parallel=TRUE))

- Implement parallel computing for growing trees when learnrate == 0

- Bar plots resulting from interact() should be opaque or non-overlapping

- Plotting of interaction statistics should be separate from their calculation

- Plotting function for full ensemble as a simple tree forest

- Support for multivariate outcomes

- Support for censored and poisson regression

- Support for multilevel data
